         <p>Hi my name is Dellano McClellan. I am currently a college student at UNLV. My major is Graphic Design and I've been learning all I can about it!</p>
         <br>
         <p>I really got into Graphic Design during my highschool year after I had picked it for my major without really knowing what it was. I knew it had to do with art but I was in for a suprise when I started learning about how many different things comes from Graphic Design!</p>
         <br>
         <p>I am hoping that in the future I can take my skills now and hone it into something better. Who knows maybe one day you'll see my work out in the World!</p>
